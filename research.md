### Working Paper
**Survey Evidence on Habit Formation** (Job Market Paper) [[PDF]](/research/habit_survey/survey_evidence_on_habit_formation.pdf)  

<font size="4">Habit formation has explained many important economic phenomena but is surrounded by controversies over its existence, specifications, and implications. To fill this gap, I document an extensive set of micro evidence for habit formation, through designing and fielding a survey eliciting ten preference parameters informative about habit formation. Habit forms both internally and externally, depreciates by 66% annually, and has equisized welfare impact as peer effect. I propose and implement four tests of additive and multiplicative habits and find that these ubiquitous preferences are rejected. Finally, I show that combining habit formation with peer effect could explain the Easterlin paradox.</font>

### Publication
**A Social Interaction Model with Ordered Choices**, with Xiaodong Liu, *Economics Letters*, 2017. [[PDF]](/research/ordered_choice/social_interactions_with_ordered_choices.pdf)  
<font size="4">We introduce a social interaction model with ordered choices. We provide a micro foundation
for the econometric model based on an incomplete information network game and characterize the sufficient condition for the existence of a unique equilibrium of the game. We discuss the identification of the model and propose to estimate the model by the NFXP and NPL algorithms. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the finite sample performance of these two estimation methods.</font>
