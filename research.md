“Survey Evidence on Habit Formation”  
PDF coming soon  
Abstract: Habit formation captures the human nature of response decrement to repetitive stimulation. Models with habit formation have explained many important economic phenomena, like the equity premium puzzle. Literature, however, disagrees or is uninformative on its micro evidence. Does habit formation exist? How fast does habit change? Are additive and multiplicative habits consistent with people's behavior? How strong is habit formation relative to keeping up with the Joneses? Can habit formation explain the Easterlin paradox? To answer these five questions, I design and field a survey eliciting ten preference parameters on habit formation. I find that both internal and external habits exist, with the latter accounting for about 17% of habit. Adjustment and cognition costs do not explain habit formation. Habit depreciates about two-thirds per year. The evidence rejects both additive and multiplicative habits. Habit formation is about as strong as keeping up with the Joneses. Combining habit formation with keeping up with the Joneses could potentially explain the Easterlin paradox.
