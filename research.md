### Job Market Paper
“Survey Evidence on Habit Formation”  
[[PDF]](/research/habit_survey/survey_evidence_on_habit_formation.pdf) 
> Abstract: Habit formation captures the diminution of human response to repetitive stimulation. Models with habit formation have been used to explain many important economic phenomena, such as the equity premium puzzle. The literature, however, disagrees or is uninformative regarding the micro evidence of habit formation, which has led to controversies over its existence, specification, and implications. To address this gap, I designed and fielded a survey eliciting ten preference parameters of habit formation. My estimates show that both internal and external habits exist, with the latter accounting for about 17% of habit. Adjustment and cognition costs do not explain habit formation. Habit depreciates by around two thirds per year. The preference of habit formation is neither additive nor multiplicative. Habit formation affects us about as much as does keeping up with the Joneses. Combining habit formation with keeping up with the Joneses could potentially explain the Easterlin paradox.

> Abstract: We introduce a social interaction model with ordered choices. We provide a micro foundation
for the econometric model based on an incomplete information network game and characterize the sufficient condition for the existence of a unique equilibrium of the game. We discuss the identification of the model and propose to estimate the model by the NFXP and NPL algorithms. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the finite sample performance of these two estimation methods.
