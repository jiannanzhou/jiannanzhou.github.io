“Survey Evidence on Habit Formation”

> Abstract: Habit formation captures the diminishing of human response to repetitive stimulation. Models with habit formation have been used to explain many important economic phenomena, such as the equity premium puzzle. The literature, however, disagrees or is uninformative on its micro evidence, which has led to controversies over its existence, specification, and implications. To fill this gap, I design and field a survey eliciting ten preference parameters on habit formation. My estimates show that both internal and external habits exist, with the latter accounting for about 17% of habit. Adjustment and cognition costs do not explain habit formation. Habit depreciates around two-thirds per year. The preference of habit formation is neither additive nor multiplicative. Habit formation affects us about as much as keeping up with the Joneses does. Combining habit formation with keeping up with the Joneses could potentially explain the Easterlin paradox.
