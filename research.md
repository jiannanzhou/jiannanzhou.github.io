### Working Paper
**Survey Evidence on Habit Formation: Existence, Specification, and Implication** (Job Market Paper) [[Paper]](/research/habit/Habit_Zhou_Paper.pdf)   
Habit formation is a staple of macroeconomics and finance, but insufficient micro evidence has led to controversies over its existence, specification, and implication. This paper documents new and extensive micro evidence for habit formation, through survey experiments eliciting ten preference parameters informative about habit formation. The evidence suggests that habit forms both internally and externally, depreciates by around two-thirds annually, and has an about equisized welfare impact as peer effect. I also propose and implement four tests of additive and multiplicative habits and find that these ubiquitous preferences are rejected. Evidence-based simulations show that combining habit formation with peer effect could explain the Easterlin paradox.

**<font size="4">A Social Interaction Model with Ordered Choices</font>**, with Xiaodong Liu, *Economics Letters*, 2017. [[Paper]](/research/social_ordered_choice/Social_Ordered_Choice_Paper.pdf) [[Appendix]](/research/social_ordered_choice/Social_Ordered_Choice_Appendix.pdf)    
We introduce a social interaction model with ordered choices. We provide a micro foundation
for the econometric model based on an incomplete information network game and characterize the sufficient condition for the existence of a unique equilibrium of the game. We discuss the identification of the model and propose to estimate the model by the NFXP and NPL algorithms. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the finite sample performance of these two estimation methods.

**Efficiency Wages and the Cost of Business Cycles**    
In many macroeconomic models, the cost of business cycle fluctuations is too small to justify the effort being put into stabilization policies, and no model from the literature that tries to generate larger costs of business cycle fluctuations has become standard. In this paper, I integrate the labor market interactions as reflected by efficiency wages into an otherwise New Keynesian model to show how fluctuations can change the mean level of unemployment, thereby creating a large cost of business cycles.

**Measuring Altruism**    
Altruism relates to the main goal of socialization, to a core attribute of personality, and to theories concerned with human nature (Krebs, 1970). However, little economic literature has measured altruism directly. Does altruism exist in peopleâ€™s economic behavior? Does it vary systematically with relationships and demographics? Structurally estimating a measure of altruism, I find that altruism exists and that after controlling for demographics and behavior, the level of altruism increases with the closeness of relationships. Senior white people who are healthier and have more children are, on average, more altruistic than others. Regarding behavior, people measured as being more selfless tend to retire later, to save more before retirement and for precautionary purposes, to be more likely to leave a bequest greater than $10,000, to transfer more than $500 to children while alive, and to spend more than 100 hours helping a grandchild.
